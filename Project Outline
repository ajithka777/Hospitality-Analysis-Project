# AtliQ Grands Hospitality Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is part of the [Codebasics.io Resume Project Challenge](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge), focusing on the application of business and data intelligence in the hospitality industry to boost revenue and regain market share for AtliQ Grands, a chain of luxury hotels in India.

### Domain
**Hospitality**

### Function
**Revenue Management**

## Background

AtliQ Grands has been a prominent player in the Indian hospitality sector for over two decades. Recently, due to competitive pressures and internal challenges in decision-making, the company has seen a downturn in its market presence and revenue generation. In response, the managing director has initiated a shift towards integrating more comprehensive data-driven strategies to regain the competitive edge.

## Challenge

Without an in-house data analytics team, AtliQ Grands has engaged a third-party service provider to mine valuable insights from their historical data. The insights are aimed at enhancing strategic decisions to improve overall revenue performance across their properties.

## Tasks

Participants in this challenge are expected to:

1. **Metric Development**: Construct various metrics that align with the business objectives and are listed in the provided metric list.
2. **Dashboard Creation**: Develop a dynamic dashboard based on a provided mock-up that visually represents the data and insights effectively.
3. **Insight Generation**: Identify and articulate insights that extend beyond the provided metrics and mock-up, offering additional value and perspective to the management of AtliQ Grands.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to harness the power of data visualization and business intelligence to:
- Analyze revenue trends and operational effectiveness.
- Identify potential areas for revenue maximization.
- Provide actionable insights that could lead to strategic improvements.

## Contributions

This project is open for contributions from individuals interested in data analysis, business intelligence, and hospitality management. Whether it's refining the dashboard, enhancing the metrics, or expanding the data analysis, your insights are welcome.
